Huge thanks to Andrei Neagoie for this course, not to mention the ZeroToMastery's Discord Community. 
Andrei is a great teacher, gave me a lot of motivation and knowledge throughout this project. It was originally made by him for the Zero to Mastery course in Udemy, but this is my own version of it. Hope you like it!
